# NFL Player Statistical Analysis - Are Modern NFL Players Bigger, Faster, and Stronger?

Every year since 1985, the NFL invites eligible college football players to attend the NFL Scouting Combine. The invitation-only event evaluates players based on size, strength, speed, power, and agility through a series of physical tests. 
A playerâ€™s performance at the combine can affect their draft status, which affects their earning potential. For some players, the combine represents their last chance at fulfilling their dream of becoming an NFL player. 
As the NFL has evolved, player positions have become more specialized, which has led to bigger, stronger, and faster players.

This project will compare NFL combine results between two time periods: (1987-1999) and (2000-2020) and use various statistical techniques to answer the question: Are Modern NFL Players Bigger, Faster, and Stronger?
